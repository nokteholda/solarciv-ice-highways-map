# EarthMC Ice Highways Map

This is a tool that aims to give information on stations and lines across the EarthMC server. However, as of April 4th, 2026, 
it only has 1998 (1955+43) stations across 319 (310+9) lines (including junctions and interchanges and elevators). You can contribute station and line information by posting an issue with the tag 'newlocation.'

***PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE ADDING STATIONS AND LINES***

This is a clarification for defining connections between lines and between branches because some of these connections are defined wrong and I am going through to fix them.

For each line, there are branches as such:
```
"Example line": {
  ...
  "branches": {
    "First branch": {
      "vertices": [[x, z], [x, z]],
      "stations": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    },
    "Second branch": {
      "vertices": [[x, z], [x, z]],
      "stations": [5, 6, 7, 8]
    }
  }
}
```
For each station, there are lines that the station is on and the specific branch it is on as well. The branch **MUST BE THE SAME NAME** as described in the line data. For example, the station with the ID 0 is on the First branch of Example line:
```
"Example station": {
  ...
  "id": 0,
  "lines": {
    "Example company": {
      "Example line": ["", "First branch"]
    }
  }
}
```
These are **CASE-SENSITIVE**. That means that if the branch name is "Main line", then the station must refer to it as "Main line", and **NOT** "Main Line" with a capital L.

Additionally, if the station connects multiple **BRANCHES WITHIN THE SAME LINE**, then the stations array of each branch must have corresponding branch references. For example, if the station 1 connects First branch and Second branch, then in the data for First branch, the stations array would look like:

`"stations": [0, [1, "Second branch"], 2, 3, 4]`

Therefore, in Second branch, there must also be an array corresponding to this one:

`"stations": [5, 6, 7, [1, "First branch"], 8]`

These arrays are **NOT** to be used to describe a line connection to another line...only from one branch to another branch within the **SAME LINE**. There is no need to specify which other lines a station may connect to; only the branches it connects to are needed.

Similarly, in the station data, use the keyword "to" to specify a connection of one branch to another branch, but **NEVER** from a line to another line. For station 1, that would looke like:
```
"lines": {
  "Example company": {
    "Example line": ["", "First branch to Second branch"]
  }
}
```
Note that the capitalization does not change, and note that it is simply the string `"First branch to Second branch"`, not an array `["First branch", "Second branch"]`.
